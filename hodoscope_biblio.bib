abstract = "The performance of scintillating fibre detectors was studied with electrons at the spectrometer facility of the Mainz microtron MAMI, as well as in a 12C beam of 2AGeV energy and in a beam of different particle species at GSI. Multi-anode photomultipliers were used to read out one or more bundles of 128 fibres each in different geometries. For electrons a time resolution of FWHM ∼ 1ns was measured in a single detector plane with a detection efficiency ε>99%. A time resolution of 310ps (FWHM) between two planes of fibres was achieved for carbon ions, leading to a FWHM ∼220ps for a single detector. The hit position residual was measured with a width of FWHM=0.27mm. The variation in the measured energy deposition was ΔE/E=15–20% (FWHM) for carbon ions. In addition, the energy response to p/π+/d particles was studied. Based on the good detector performance fibre hodoscopes will be constructed for the Kaos/A1spectrometer at MAMI and for the HypHI experiment at GSI."

abstract = "A Compton camera-based detector system for photon detection from nuclear reactions induced by proton (or heavier ion) beams is under development at LMU Munich, targeting the online range verification of the particle beam in hadron therapy via prompt-gamma imaging. The detector is designed to be capable to reconstruct the photon source origin not only from the Compton scattering kinematics of the primary photon, but also to allow for tracking of the secondary Compton-scattered electrons, thus enabling a γ-source reconstruction also from incompletely absorbed photon events. The Compton camera consists of a monolithic LaBr3:Ce scintillation crystal, read out by a multi-anode PMT acting as absorber, preceded by a stacked array of 6 double-sided silicon strip detectors as scatterers. The detector components have been characterized both under offline and online conditions. The LaBr3:Ce crystal exhibits an excellent time and energy resolution. Using intense collimated 137Cs and 60Co sources, the monolithic scintillator was scanned on a fine 2D grid to generate a reference library of light amplitude distributions that allows for reconstructing the photon interaction position using a k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. Systematic studies were performed to investigate the performance of the reconstruction algorithm, revealing an improvement of the spatial resolution with increasing photon energy to an optimum value of 3.7(1)mm at 1.33MeV, achieved with the Categorical Average Pattern (CAP) modification of the k-NN algorithm."

	abstract = {The physical range uncertainty limits the exploitation of the full potential of charged particle therapy. In this work, we face this issue aiming to measure the absolute Bragg peak position in the target. We investigate p, 4He, 12C and 16O beams accelerated at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center. The residual range of the primary 12C ions is correlated to the energy spectrum of the prompt gamma radiation. The prompt gamma spectroscopy method was demonstrated for proton beams accelerated by cyclotrons and is developed here for the first time for heavier ions accelerated by a synchrotron. We develop a detector system that includes (i) a spectroscopic unit based on cerium(III) bromide and bismuth germanium oxide scintillating crystals, (ii) a beam trigger based on an array of scintillating fibers and (iii) a data acquisition system based on a FlashADC. We test the system in two different scenarios. In the first series of experiments, we detect and identify 19 independent spectral lines over a wide gamma energy spectrum in the presence of the four ion species for different targets, including a water target with a titanium insert. In the second series of experiments, we introduce a collimator aiming to relate the spectral information to the range of the primary particles. We perform extensive measurements for a 12C beam and demonstrate submillimetric precision for the measurement of its Bragg peak position in the experimental setup. The features of the energy and time spectra for gamma radiation induced by p, 4He and 16O are investigated upstream and downstream from the Bragg peak position. We conclude the analysis by extrapolating the required future developments, which would be needed to achieve range verification with a 2 mm accuracy during a single fraction delivery of  physical dose.}

Each channel of the ASIC consists of one input current conveyor driving separately a current comparator for signal event detection and a charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA) for signal charge measurement. The ASIC has brought significant improvements compared to its previous version: larger input dynamic range (53 dB against 33 dB), lower power consumption (11 mW/channel instead of 22 mW/channel under a 3.3-V supply), lower noise (4 fC versus 19 fC in Equivalent input Noise Charge, or ENC) and a better phase margin for optimizing stability and speed. This dedicated chip had been used in a beam test at HIT (Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center). System testing has shown achievements of 1 mm spatial resolution (size of the scintillating fibers) and a 4 MHz count rate. The main limitation comes from the Ma-PMTs which saturates at such a frequency. The ASIC operates normally with satisfied performances.},

  abstract = {Charged particle therapy has been largely driven and influenced by nuclear physics. The increase in energy deposition density along the ion path in the body allows reducing the dose to normal tissues during radiotherapy compared to photons. Clinical results of particle therapy support the physical rationale for this treatment, but the method remains controversial because of the high cost and of the lack of comparative clinical trials proving the benefit compared to x-rays. Research in applied nuclear physics, including nuclear interactions, dosimetry, image guidance, range verification, novel accelerators and beam delivery technologies, can significantly improve the clinical outcome in particle therapy. Measurements of fragmentation cross-sections, including those for the production of positron-emitting fragments, and attenuation curves are needed for tuning Monte Carlo codes, whose use in clinical environments is rapidly increasing thanks to fast calculation methods. Existing cross sections and codes are indeed not very accurate in the energy and target regions of interest for particle therapy. These measurements are especially urgent for new ions to be used in therapy, such as helium. Furthermore, nuclear physics hardware developments are frequently finding applications in ion therapy due to similar requirements concerning sensors and real-time data processing. In this review we will briefly describe the physics bases, and concentrate on the open issues.},

	journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
	abstract = {Proton and ion beams open up new vistas for the curative treatment of tumors, but adequate technologies for monitoring the compliance of dose delivery with treatment plans in real time are still missing. Range assessment, meaning the monitoring of therapy-particle ranges in tissue during dose delivery (treatment), is a continuous challenge considered a key for tapping the full potential of particle therapies. In this context the paper introduces an unconventional concept of range assessment by prompt-gamma timing (PGT), which is based on an elementary physical effect not considered so far: therapy particles penetrating tissue move very fast, but still need a finite transit time—about 1–2 ns in case of protons with a 5–20 cm range—from entering the patient’s body until stopping in the target volume. The transit time increases with the particle range. This causes measurable effects in PGT spectra, usable for range verification. The concept was verified by proton irradiation experiments at the AGOR cyclotron, KVI-CART, University of Groningen. Based on the presented kinematical relations, we describe model calculations that very precisely reproduce the experimental results. As the clinical treatment conditions entail measurement constraints (e.g. limited treatment time), we propose a setup, based on clinical irradiation conditions, capable of determining proton range deviations within a few seconds of irradiation, thus allowing for a fast safety survey. Range variations of 2 mm are expected to be clearly detectable.}

abstract = {Acoustic waves are induced via the thermoacoustic effect in objects exposed to a pulsed beam of ionizing radiation. This phenomenon has interesting potential applications in both radiotherapy dosimetry and treatment guidance as well as low-dose radiological imaging. After initial work in the field in the 1980s and early 1990s, little research was done until 2013 when interest was rejuvenated, spurred on by technological advances in ultrasound transducers and the increasing complexity of radiotherapy delivery systems. Since then, many studies have been conducted and published applying ionizing radiation-induced acoustic principles into three primary research areas: Linear accelerator photon beam dosimetry, proton therapy range verification, and radiological imaging. This review article introduces the theoretical background behind ionizing radiation-induced acoustic waves, summarizes recent advances in the field, and provides an outlook on how the detection of ionizing radiation-induced acoustic waves can be used for relative and in vivo dosimetry in photon therapy, localization of the Bragg peak in proton therapy, and as a low-dose medical imaging modality. Future prospects and challenges for the clinical implementation of these techniques are discussed.},

At HIT protons, helium, carbon, and oxygen ions are available for therapy and experiments.  The beam can be scanned in two dimensions using fast deflection magnets. A tracking system is used to monitor beam position and to adjust scanning magnet currents online.  A new detector system with a finer granularity and without the drift time delay of the current MWPC system with a similar amount of material along the beamline would prove valuable in patient treatment.  The sensitive detector components in the tested prototype detector are double-clad Kuraray SCSF-78MJ scintillating fibres with a diameter of 0.250 mm wound as a thin multi-layer ribbon. The scintillation light is detected at the end of the ribbon with Hamamatsu S11865-64  photodiode arrays with a pitch of 0.8 mm. Commercial or readily available readout electronics have been used to evaluate the system feasibility.   The results shown in this paper include the linearity with respect to beam intensity, the RMS of the beam intensity as measured by two planes, along with the RMS of the mean position, and the measured beam width RMS. The Signal-to-Noise ratio of the current system is also measured as an indicator of potential performance. Additionally, the non-linear light yield of the scintillating fibres as measured by the photodiode arrays is compared to two models which describe the light yield as a function of the ion stopping power and Lorentz β.}

	abstract={In order to fully exploit the ballistic potential of particle therapy, we propose an online range monitoring concept based on Time-Of-Flight (TOF)-resolved Prompt Gamma (PG) detection in a single proton counting regime. In a proof of principle experiment, different types of monolithic scintillating gamma detectors are read in time coincidence with a diamond-based beam hodoscope, in order to build TOF spectra of PG generated in a target presenting an air cavity of variable thickness. Since the measurement was carried out at low beam currents (< 1 proton/bunch) it was possible to reach excellent coincidence time resolutions, of the order of 100 ps (σ). Our goal is to detect possible deviations of the proton range with respect to treatment planning within a few intense irradiation spots at the beginning of the session and then carry on the treatment at standard beam currents. The measurements were limited to 10 mm proton range shift. A Monte Carlo simulation study reproducing the experiment has shown that a 3 mm shift can be detected at 2σ by a single detector of ∼ 1.4 × 10−3 absolute detection efficiency within a single irradiation spot (∼108 protons) and an optimised experimental set-up.}

	journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
	abstract = {The main advantages of proton therapy are the reduced total energy deposited in the patient as compared to photon techniques and the finite range of the proton beam. The latter adds an additional degree of freedom to treatment planning. The range in tissue is associated with considerable uncertainties caused by imaging, patient setup, beam delivery and dose calculation. Reducing the uncertainties would allow a reduction of the treatment volume and thus allow a better utilization of the advantages of protons. This paper summarizes the role of Monte Carlo simulations when aiming at a reduction of range uncertainties in proton therapy. Differences in dose calculation when comparing Monte Carlo with analytical algorithms are analyzed as well as range uncertainties due to material constants and CT conversion. Range uncertainties due to biological effects and the role of Monte Carlo for in vivo range verification are discussed. Furthermore, the current range uncertainty recipes used at several proton therapy facilities are revisited. We conclude that a significant impact of Monte Carlo dose calculation can be expected in complex geometries where local range uncertainties due to multiple Coulomb scattering will reduce the accuracy of analytical algorithms. In these cases Monte Carlo techniques might reduce the range uncertainty by several mm.}

Current measurements show promising results: already for a single fibre layer and minimum ionizing particles we obtain a detection efficiency ≥95% (mean collected light/fibre ≈ 8phe), a timing resolution of 550ps/fibre and a foreseen spatial resolution <100μm, based on the achieved negligible optical cross-talk between fibres (<1%). We will also discuss the performances of a double-layer staggered prototype configuration, for which a full detection efficiency (≥99%) has been measured together with a timing resolution of ≈ 400ps for double hit events."

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly considered as an effective imaging method to support several stages of radiation therapy. The combined usage of functional and morphological imaging in state-of-the-art PET/CT scanners is rapidly emerging to support the treatment planning process in terms of improved tumor delineation, and to assess the tumor response in follow-up investigations after or even during the course of fractionated therapy. Moreover, active research is being pursued on new tracers capable of providing different insights into tumor function, in order to identify areas of the planning volume which may require additional dosage for improved probability of tumor control. In this respect, major progresses in the next years will likely concern the development and clinical investigation of novel tracers and image processing techniques for reliable thresholding and segmentation, of treatment planning and beam delivery approaches integrating the PET imaging information, as well as improved multimodal clinical instrumentation such as PET/MR. But especially in the rapidly emerging case of ion beam therapy, the usage of PET is not only limited to the imaging of external tracers injected to the patient. In fact, a minor amount of positron emitters is formed in nuclear fragmentation reactions between the impinging ions and the tissue, bearing useful information for confirmation of the delivered treatment during or after therapeutic irradiation. Different implementations of unconventional PET imaging for therapy monitoring are currently being investigated clinically, and major ongoing research aims at new dedicated detector technologies and at challenging applications such as real-time imaging and time-resolved in vivo verification of motion compensated beam delivery. This paper provides an overview of the different areas of application of PET in radiation oncology and discusses the most promising perspectives in the years to come for radiation therapy planning, delivery, and monitoring.},

The main results regarding the system architecture have been used as a demonstration of the technique which has been patented by the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN). The prototype of this tracker, presented  in this paper, has a 20 × 20 cm2 sensitive area, consisting of two crossed ribbons of 500 micron square scintillating fibers. The track position information is extracted in real time in an innovative way, using a reduced number of read-out channels to obtain very large detection area with moderate enough costs and complexity. The performance of the tracker was investigated using beta sources, cosmic rays, and a 62 MeV proton beam.}

	journal = {Physics in Medicine \& Biology},
	abstract = {In proton therapy, patients benefit from the precise deposition of the dose in the tumor volume due to the interaction of charged particles with matter. Currently, the determination of the beam range in the patient’s body during the treatment is not a clinical standard. This lack causes broad safety margins around the tumor, which limits the potential of proton therapy. To overcome this obstacle, different methods are under investigation aiming at the verification of the proton range in real time during the irradiation. One approach is the prompt gamma-ray timing (PGT) method, where the range of the primary protons is derived from time-resolved profiles (PGT spectra) of promptly emitted gamma rays, which are produced along the particle track in tissue. After verifying this novel technique in an experimental environment but far away from treatment conditions, the translation of PGT into clinical practice is intended. Therefore, new hardware was extensively tested and characterized using short irradiation times of 70 ms and clinical beam currents of 2 nA. Experiments were carried out in the treatment room of the University Proton Therapy Dresden. A pencil beam scanning plan was delivered to a target without and with cylindrical air cavities of down to 5 mm thickness. The range shifts of the proton beam induced due to the material variation could be identified from the corresponding PGT spectra, comprising events collected during the delivery of a whole energy layer. Additionally, an assignment of the PGT data to the individual pencil beam spots allowed a spot-wise analysis of the variation of the PGT distribution mean and width, corresponding to range shifts produced by the different air cavities. Furthermore, the paper presents a comprehensive software framework which standardizes future PGT analysis methods and correction algorithms for technical limitations that have been encountered in the presented experiments.}

For SRIM-2010, the following major improvements have been made: (1) About 2800 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 28,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on SRIM stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained SRIM module has been included to allow SRIM stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. (5) Individual interatomic potentials have been included for all ion/atom collisions, and these potentials are now included in the SRIM package. A full catalog of stopping power plots can be downloaded at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by SRIM along with 27,000 experimental data points.
